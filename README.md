Timeflecks
==========

Timeflecks is a project that will enable users to organize and schedule their tasks. Most of today’s calendar solutions focus on scheduling events with specific start and end times. Tasks, on the other hand, can be completed in any time slot, but still require time in a user’s schedule to complete. Timeflecks allows a user to enter their tasks, to view them as a regular to-do list, and to place them on a calendar for easy scheduling. This enables them to budget their time more effectively, to reduce stress, and to set more realistic goals. Timeflecks gives users the tools to organize their tasks and their free time.
