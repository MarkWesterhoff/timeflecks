Features (Ideas):
JARGON
 - "Itâ€™s meant to show you what you WANT to spend 
	your own time on."
 - "There needs to be an easy throw it in with 
	2 clicks and voila."
- "Overall goal is quick and easy use, incredibly 
   easy and intuitive to make changes, and user-focused, 
   not meeting-focused."
   
GENERAL

TASKS

	- In-time management
		- Can extend the task you are working on (like a continue)
			- Will override other tasks
			- LEARN: Learn habits here and suggest permanent changes
		- Options for Overridden Tasks
			- 1. Push back (some or all)
			- 2. Ignore the one(s) overwritten
			- 3. Reschedule
			- LEARN: Suggest a schedule
		- When a Task is Completed
			- 1. On Time - Do nothing
			- 2. Early - Suggest moving up tasks
				- 1. Push up the tasks

				- Or do nothing
			- 3. Late
				- 1. Override tasks & continue current task

	- Unfinished Task
		- Tasks not completed get a Partial Completion tag
		- REACH: Possibly have a percent complete
			- Problems:
				- 1. People are bad at judging tasks
				- 2. How to do we handle reopening a task?

	- Task Groups
		- Groups are weird
		- Allow multiple groups
	- LEARN: Suggest Schedules	
	- Other Thoughts
		- Scheduling Conflicts (not overriding)
